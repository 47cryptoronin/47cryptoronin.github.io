# 47 Crypto Ronin

## Forty seven ronin
In feudal-era Japan, the land was split into segments, each ruled by a warlord. In the Ako region, the Asano clan held the fort.

Asano has been treated badly by a powerful high ranking official named Kira. At some point, Kira provoked Asano into drawing his dagger and attacking him, landing a deep gash on his brow. This meant Asano had committed a serious crime and eventually Asano was forced to kill himself.

Upon his death, his region was almost completely dissolved and the 300 odd samurai who served his house became Ronin (masterless samurai, without honor).

The new ronin were instructed to sheath their blades, and never to take revenge for their master. Most of them relented, and disappeared into the country. 
Only 47 remained defiant, and believed it was upon them to avenge their master and regain their honor.

When the time finally came to finalize their revenge, the 47 ronin, with weapons, armor set upon Kira's household, and very efficiently captured the compound and beheaded Kira.

Kira's head was brought to Asano's grave as a final act of respect. The ronin then turned themselves in, knowing that they were to be executed for their crime. The officials in charge however, realized that in forsaking the country's laws, they had upheld the Bushido (Samurai Code), and thus granted them the honor of Seppuku as well. They died by their own blades at the grave of Asano, and are buried there today.
